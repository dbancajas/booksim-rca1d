1. To run RCA-1D algorithm, uncomment the corresponding routing function in mesh88_rca1d
2. The mesh88_rca1d script is to be used by analysis.sh
3. The analysis.sh script will run a parametric analysis, changing the injection rate.
4. The code for the RCA-1D routing algo is in routefunc.cpp:rca1d_mesh() function.

Note that the RCA-1D in this implementation takes the congestion in each dimension, X and Y for the
possible paths of the flit. The congestion metric used is the occupancy of the buffer in the 
particular input. All congestion info are gathered and average. The path with the lower congestion
value is then chosen as the path.

I have tried running this and the performance is similar to XY routing. But I
only ran it on hotspot traffic and uniform. It might need extensive testing or
optimization/tuning to achieve the same performance with the RCA paper.
